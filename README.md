# Zazen Website and Meditation Timer

A website about Zazen that includes information about how to practice meditation and a practice timer. Created for a 3-week workshop at SheCodes. This was my first time coding.
<br /><br />
I love to medidate and I'm really into Soto Zen Buddhism. When I find out I had to pick a topic to create a website for the coding workshop I was taking, I immediately thought of creating a website about Zazen.
<br /><br />
First, the page only had the text and image explaining Zazen meditation and where it comes from.
After a couple of weeks, I decided to add and JS interactions, and finally the timer.
<br /><br />
As always, feel free to use or make any suggestions. I hope you like it.
