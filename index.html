      <strong>Zazen</strong>, literally "seated meditation" is a meditative discipline that is
        typically the primary practice of the Zen Buddhist tradition. The
        meaning and method of zazen varies from school to school, but in general
        it can be regarded as a means of insight into the nature of existence.
        In the Japanese Rinzai school, zazen is usually associated with the
        study of koans. The Soto School of Japan, on the other hand, only rarely
        incorporates koans into zazen, preferring an approach where the mind has
        no object at all, known as shikantaza. Zazen is considered the heart of
        Japanese Soto Zen Buddhist practice. The aim of zazen is just sitting,
        that is, suspending all judgmental thinking and letting words, ideas,
        images and thoughts pass by without getting involved in them. Shikantaza
        is a form of meditation, in which the practitioner does not use any
        specific object of meditation; rather, practitioners remain as much as
        possible in the present moment, aware of and observing what passes
        through their minds and around them. Dogen says, in his Shobogenzo,
        <em
          >"Sitting fixedly, think of not thinking. How do you think of not
          thinking? Nonthinking. This is the art of zazen".</em
